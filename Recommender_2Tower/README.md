This project designs and implements a **deep learning-based recommender system** using a **two-tower neural architecture**, capable of delivering scalable and personalized product suggestions. It combines **structured data**, **textual product descriptions**, and **product images** to improve recommendation performance.

The model is trained on the [H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations) from Kaggle.

## Key Features

- **Two-Tower Neural Network**: Separate encoders for users and items, enabling efficient candidate retrieval at scale  
- **Multimodal Input**: Combines structured features with image and text embeddings  
- **Transformer Encoder Integration**: A BERT-like module is integrated into the system trained from scratch to distill richer information from grouped modalities  

<br>

## Data Modalities

The system integrates:

- **User Information**:
  - User ID, age, active status, fashion news frequency, etc.

- **Product Information**:
  - Product type, textual description, product image (processed into embeddings), etc.

- **Transaction Logs**:
  - Userâ€“item purchases with metadata (price, timestamp, sales channel)
